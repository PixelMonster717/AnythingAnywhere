* You cannot place objects on top of another object
* You cannot place objects or furniture inside of the mines

This toggle will set the costs of all blueprints to be free and will make buildings build instantly.

##### `Build Anywhere Menu`

##### `Wizard Build Menu`

##### `Building Modifier Key`
When this key is held down while you are building, upgrading, or destroying buildings, you will not be kicked out of the menu.\
This lets you build or destroy buildings really fast, no more waiting 15 seconds each time you want to build multiple fish ponds.\
Building or upgrading multiple buildings will still consume resources, you will be kicked out of the menu if you run out. 

##### `Enable Greenhouse`
This toggle adds the Greenhouse as a blueprint that you can build. To unlock the blueprint you need to have the Greenhouse unlocked in the Community Center or the Joja path.\
The blueprint costs:
* 150,000 Gold
* 100 Hardwood
* 20 Refined Quartz
* 10 Iridium Bars

This works with mods that add buildings locked behind certain events too.

##### `Build Indoors`
This toggle enables building structures indoors. This can lead to errors.\
For example entering a building that you built inside of the coop will soft lock the game, requiring a restart.\
Building inside of the farmhouse and greenhouse does work though. If you have the Farmhouse Fixes mod make sure you enable `Non-Hardcoded Warps` in that mod.

##### `Magic Ink Bypass`
This toggle skips the check for magic ink when opening the Wizards build menu.\
This only works for this mods Wizards build menu, you sill need magic ink to open the Wizards menu at the tower.

##### `Hide Location`
This button will add the current player location to a list to not display in Robins build menu.\
When opening up the build menu the map properties "AlwaysActive" and "CanBuildHere" are set to true for the current location.\
To remove non blacklisted locations with no buildings from Robins menu, reload your save.

- [Hoe Anything](#hoe-anything)
- [Fruit Tree Tweaks](#fruit-tree-tweaks)
- [Wild Tree Tweaks](#wild-tree-tweaks)

##

##### `Enable Farming`
This toggle marks all locations as plantable, and makes most dirt tiles hoeable.\
This enables farming in all locations with dirt.\
Note that some dirt tiles added in 1.6 aren't labeled as dirt, and thus cannot be hoed, a simple fix for this is to enable the `Hoe Anything` toggle.

##### `Hoe Anything`
This toggle will let the player hoe any tile. This will make farming on stone or other non-dirt tiles possible. 

##### `Fruit Tree Tweaks`
This toggle will remove the placement and growth restrictions on fruit trees.\
This will let you plant them as close together as you want and the growth won't be blocked by other trees or walls

##### `Wild Tree Tweaks`
This toggle will remove the placement and growth restrictions on wild trees.\
This includes things like acorn, pine, maple, and mahogany seeds.\
